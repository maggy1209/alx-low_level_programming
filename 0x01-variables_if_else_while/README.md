# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while.

## Mandatory tasks.

* `Task 0 :` - program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed.
* `Task 1 :` - program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed.
* `Task 2 :` - this program will print the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
* `Task 3 :` - program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
* `Task 4 :` - Writing a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
* `Task 5 :` - program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
* `Task 6 :` - program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
You are not allowed to use any variable of type 'char'
You can only use the 'putchar' function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
You can only use 'putchar' twice in your code
All your code should be in the 'main' function
* `Task 7 :` - program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.
You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden).
All your code should be in the main function.
You can only use putchar twice in your code.
* `Task 8 :`- program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.
You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)

1. `Task 0 :` -function that checks for uppercase character.
2. `Task 1 :` -function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).

*.Prototype: int _isdigit(int c);
*.Returns 1 if c is a digit
*.Returns 0 otherwise
3. `Task 2 :` -function that multiplies two integers.

*Prototype: int mul(int a, int b);
4. `Task 3 :` -function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
5. `Task 4 :` - function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

    * Prototype: `void print_most_numbers(void);`
    * Do not print `2` and `4`
    * You can only use `_putchar` twice in your code.
6. `Task 5 :` - function that prints 10 times the numbers, from `0` to `14`, followed by a new line.
7. `Task 6 :` - function that draws a straight line in the terminal.
8. `Task 7 :` - function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.
9. `Task 8 :` - function that prints a square, followed by a new line.
